// This program is a test case for nested procedures working properly.

// The compiler uses the name of a procedure as its label. This can cause
// problems when a local procedure *inside* another procedure has the same name
// as a procedure in an enclosing scope. The local procedure should _shadow_ the
// outer procedure, so calls to that name in the inner procedure should call
// the inner, not outer, procedure.

// Look at the assembly produced by compiling this program and see how the
// shadowing operates. Which labels are called at which points?
